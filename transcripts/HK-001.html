            <strong>Participant Background:</strong> Hong Kong native who participated directly in the 2019 protests, influenced significantly by their older brother. First attended protests as a minor during the June 2019 demonstrations. The interview includes discussion of protest tactics, violence, ethnic tensions in Hong Kong, and views on democracy and justice.

        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Can you briefly introduce yourself? For example, where do you come from and what is a symbol or idea that represents Hong Kong for you?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Okay, so I'm a Hongkonger. I was born in Hong Kong and have lived there my whole life. I'm someone who cares deeply for Hong Kong. [In terms of a] symbol or idea that represents Hong Kong‚Ä¶I'd say it's the first frontier of the free world against China. [I don't really know] about symbols? I don't have any in my mind right now.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Got it. How do you view the relationship between the "free world" and China? Where do you define as the "free-world"?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">[The] free world is to me obviously Europe and Canada now; I would've said the U.S. a while ago but that's getting tenuous. Alongside these, I'd say Australia, ASEAN, Japan, Korea, India, [and] basically the democracies of the world.</p>
        
        <p class="response">The relationship between China and the free world is an interesting question. I'd say China is an active adversary trying to dismantle the rules-based international order, alongside other powers like Russia. But they do it in a much more covert way, and only to the benefit of themselves.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Understood. How would you say you first learned/got involved in the movements for Hong Kong? You mentioned that your brother was a big influence. Was the rest of your family in agreement in terms of these issues?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">[The] first time I learned about [the movements] was during dinner between me and my family. We had the TV on like normal. Then, the newsreels of [the event] popped up.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Getting involved was mostly with my brother going out and bringing me along to the protests. The rest of my family['s attitude ranges from] ambivalent to hostile to the protestors.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">How did you grow to believe that something was wrong? What prompted you to get on the streets, even though there might be clear dangers?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">I think, as a child, I was always very pro-freedom and interested in politics (I would spend my free time on [Wikipedia] just reading current affairs and history). If you ask me how and why I [got involved] back then, I don't really know. Now I viscerally remember seeing one of my brother['s] friends getting shot by a rubber bullet and getting beat up by police.</p>
        
        <p class="response">[There were] many many other horror stories, from people getting pulled behind pillars to get beat up to female protesters being harassed by [the] police. It's [an] injustice. It's tyranny, and I will carry on the mantle and fight against that no matter the cost.</p>
        
        <p class="response">In terms of what prompted me, I would say my brother obviously was the person who led me to the streets. I honestly never really felt the danger. Maybe I just don't remember it now [though]. It's all a bit fuzzy now.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Let's go back to your first protest...what did you see or feel at the time? Were you scared?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">It was June 16th during the "2 million+1" protest. I saw tons and tons of people holding signs, and I remembered the MTR being flooded with people in the morning when we were getting to Central. [I was] not really scared [since] we left before any major confrontations. It was just a march really.</p>
        
        <p class="response">It was sensory overload, too; I remember that a lot. So many things happening all at once. It took me a while to adjust to that.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Historical Context: June 16, 2019 Protest</h4>
            <p>The June 16, 2019 protest was one of the largest demonstrations in Hong Kong's history, with organizers claiming nearly 2 million participants (hence the reference to "2 million+1"). This followed the June 9 protest and came after the government's announcement to suspend (but not withdraw) the extradition bill. The demonstration was largely peaceful, with participants marching from Victoria Park to the Legislative Council complex.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I remember being in Mainland reading the HK news in 2019, and most of what I was reading about was the violence that was occurring - like this elderly person getting burned on a bridge or something like that. Were events like that frequent, from your experience? If they were truly somewhat violent, did your opinion of the movement shift?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Was there violence in the movement? Yes.</p>
        
        <p class="response">There were extreme sectors who fought the police's fire with fire. However, we mostly just escalated because [of] the police and government.</p>
        
        <p class="response">1. [They] did not listen to us when we were making our demands through peaceful means (we have been fighting for democracy[,] freedom and all that since 1997).</p>
        
        <p class="response">2. [We then] escalated [to] violence, [first on] 7/21 when they ignored protestors getting beat up by gangs (affiliated with the government), [next on] 8/31 when police beat people up in the subways, and 10/1 when they shot a protester.</p>
        
        <p class="response">They definitely got more frequent as the movement went on, as the peaceful sectors started to die down and get replaced by who we call "the brave ones" as we could see in the [PolyU] siege and events near the tail end of the movement. My opinion now is firmly that violence is a necessary means to political solution when all else fails, and I will not condemn violence solely for condemning violence. However, senseless violence should be condemned. Some people who got hurt by us definitely shouldn't have. Like, if I remember correctly, [the] elderly worker who got hit by a brick.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Historical Context: Key Escalation Events</h4>
            <p><strong>July 21 (7/21):</strong> The Yuen Long attack, where masked men in white shirts attacked protesters and civilians at the Yuen Long MTR station. Police response was widely criticized as inadequate.</p>
            <p><strong>August 31 (8/31):</strong> Prince Edward station incident, where police entered the MTR station and used force against passengers, leading to widespread allegations of brutality.</p>
            <p><strong>October 1 (10/1):</strong> A protester was shot in the chest with live ammunition by police during National Day protests.</p>
            <p><strong>PolyU Siege:</strong> The November 2019 siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where protesters and police clashed for nearly two weeks, resulting in numerous arrests.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I was just going to ask that question, actually. What do you think "civic duty" entails? (As in, many I have talked to believe that their job is just to make money and abide by the law, while I assume you believe otherwise). Secondly, where do you draw the line between "acceptable" versus "unacceptable" means of voicing disagreements?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">In my opinion, civic duty is the responsibility of every citizen to defend their rights, their freedoms, their democracy, [and] their friends. If people don't have that sense of civic duty, democracy is fraught, even if that is not "legal."</p>
        
        <p class="response">Now, in terms of what is acceptable/unacceptable, I don't think there's a clean answer to this. To me, it really depends on context. If you could give me some case studies, I could discuss what I think about them specifically [in order that you] understand my viewpoint about that.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Well, I guess the role of violence would be a good place to start. To what degree do you think force should be avoided or used when defending a perceived right?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Again, it really depends on context. Violence in politics is a really bad word; no one likes it [and] no one condones it. But the practical reality is that violence cannot be avoided.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Format Note:</strong> At this point in the interview, the conversation switched from text to audio call. The following represents the audio portion of the interview.
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">No, because the thing is, let me start off with prefacing: the word violence within politics is kind of a‚Ä¶It's a banned term. I think no one would want to condone violence. At least no sane person would, like, in public, right?</p>
        
        <p class="response">And I feel like‚Ä¶ yes, in an ideal world, we shouldn't stoop down to violence. But again, we live in a world where it's not ideal. There are times where I have to resort to violence to achieve political goals.</p>
        
        <p class="response">And so, if you ask me what I draw the line‚Ä¶ what's the line I draw for violence is‚Ä¶I think‚Ä¶ mmm‚Ä¶I would say‚Ä¶I support violence only as the final fight. The final‚Ä¶Hmm. What's the right word here? As‚Ä¶ it's the‚Ä¶It's the end. It's the end means, I think.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Because it's‚Ä¶ if you have tried‚Ä¶ if you have tried every single other way to achieve your goal within the system, outside of the system, peacefully. And if your goal has failed, say, I don't think violence is necessarily bad, but you have to have tried everything. And obviously, it's kind of, like, selfish or weird to say this. I'll obviously only believe [that violence is justified] in the fight for my ideals. I don't think violence should be used in hate. I think that is horrible. I think violence should only be used in the preservation of democracy, in the preservation of civic identity, in the preservation of a country.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I don't want my words to be warped into saying, I support violence. There's a line. I think it's about using violence to just defend a civic institution to defend democracy. I'd say that that will be like the broad way to say it, but, yeah, along the lines of that.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I guess I have two follow ups to that. One follow up is, why does democracy matter to you? Just from my perspective, I'm someone who grew up for a very long time in Mainland, and obviously that wasn't a component that people focused on. Instead, it was the safety, the economics of a regime. So why does [democracy] particularly resonate with you?</p>
        
        <p class="response">Second, where could the violence be applied to? Because, as you said, even in those movements, it's unfair to apply violence to the people that are unaffected, the bystanders, right? So, is there a group of people that you think should just be left out of it completely?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Hmm, okay. So to answer your first question. Why is democracy [important to me]? I will answer for [myself] personally.</p>
        
        <p class="response">And in my opinion, I think Hong Kong's a really special place in the world. Between the UK as a former colonial power and China, we have never had this right to control our own destiny, let's say. If you look at the handover between the UK and China, the debates were always between the UK and China as governing colonial powers. And when we were given the limited sort of democracy, we had the very weird legislative system of the LegCo, and the district council, and even that limited democracy was taken away from us.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I think, for me‚Ä¶ it's very hard to answer why I‚Ä¶[care about democracy]. I like freedom‚Ä¶I think it's important [for] people to have freedom, and I think democracy is one of the best ways to maintain that freedom. When I talked about this to some of my Chinese relatives, one of the ways I've put it is that democracy is about giving people a voice. And even if, let's say, you only care about safety, the economics, you don't care about freedoms, right? It's fine. Then there is one day where if you don't care about politics, politics will catch up to you. And you do not want that day to be when you do not have the power to speak, when you do not have the power to vote, and when you do not have the power to change your outcome. Because there is going to be a day where the government will implement policies that will negatively affect your lives. Democracy gives the people power, right? And I think that's really important in society, even if you only care about safety, even if you only care about economics and jobs.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Hong Kong's Limited Democracy</h4>
            <p>Hong Kong's political system under "One Country, Two Systems" featured several democratic elements that were progressively restricted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legislative Council (LegCo):</strong> Only half the seats were directly elected; the other half came from "functional constituencies" representing business and professional sectors</li>
                <li><strong>District Councils:</strong> More directly democratic but with limited power, later reformed after 2019 to reduce elected seats</li>
                <li><strong>Chief Executive:</strong> Selected by a small election committee, not universal suffrage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The demand for "genuine universal suffrage" was central to both the 2014 and 2019 movements.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="response">So, to your second question. Basically, who can violence be employed against. I think, obviously, we should limit violence as much as possible, even within a movement.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Mhm.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">I'd say‚Ä¶ there's no‚Ä¶ again, it's really hard to draw a clear line. I'd say obvious‚Ä¶ obviously, civilians shouldn't be involved. I don't think the ordinary man should be killed for the wrongdoings of the government. Nor should they be harmed. But there is the question of‚Ä¶whether‚Ä¶ like, what's the line? Like, are police officers civilians? Many of them just do their job, basically. Should we employ violence, even though police officers have employed violence against protesters? Should we fight back against that, even though a lot of them are just doing their jobs? Or should we only limit violence to the higher echelons, [like] the government officials? Even then, are the government officials really [at fault]? Even though‚Ä¶a lot of what they're doing might be harming the people, I don't think a lot of them are actually bad people. I think there are a lot of them who are self-serving, who seek power. And again, it's really hard to draw the line of where violence should be employed, and it's impossible to say. There are many times where, within historical events, you see what you might see as senseless violence, and‚Ä¶I feel like the line between senseless violence and good violence‚Ä¶there's no line. It's‚Ä¶It's really based on context, and how you perceive the world.</p>
        
        <p class="response">So, let's take an example recently, Charlie Kirk. He got shot, right? I'm not sure about your political views on this, but for me, Charlie Kirk wasn't a good person. He spewed hatred on minorities. He spewed hatred on many groups, at least in my opinion. Obviously, I don't know yours, and I would love to discuss this with you later, but‚Ä¶for me‚Ä¶And is it right to kill someone who has spewed‚Ä¶ who has‚Ä¶ even though Charlie Kirk isn't involved with violence, right? He hasn't killed anyone. However, his words have incited people to do horrible things. His words have convinced people to a belief which I believe is detrimental to society. Is his killing morally correct? Is his killing justified from a political violence perspective? In my opinion, I'd say yes. And I think you can draw your own interpretations of my beliefs there, and you can ask me more questions from there.</p>

        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">To take a step back from this discussion, two things that I'm really interested about. First‚Ä¶obviously‚Ä¶most families will think about this as, "this is an incredibly difficult problem. Why do you want to risk yourself to solve this incredibly high threshold problem?" That might put you at big risk, but might not give you so many benefits. The second question would be, how do you feel like the Hong Kong youth thinks about [the protests] now?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Okay, so, to answer your first question‚Ä¶let me give you some specific anecdotes. I think after the protests did get, indeed, considerably more violent, I think there was significant conflict between my brothers and my family.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Okay.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">So, from there, I think a lot of it was their concern for our safety. Their concern, which is‚Ä¶ I think it's very justified.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Um, to your question about big risk, low benefit, like‚Ä¶ why risk ourselves, right?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">I think at that time, I didn't really think about this question, but‚Ä¶it's been, what, 5 to 6 years now?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">And I think throughout this time, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to fight, what it means to risk yourself, what it means to‚Ä¶To put it frankly, I don't think Hong Kong has a great chance [for] democracy within the next 50 years.</p>
        
        <p class="response">And‚Ä¶ to this end‚Ä¶because I'm still involved in the social movement a lot. I still go out to our memorials, our tributes, I still do some freelance photography for pro-democracy activists, and for events, and I do some journalism myself, too. And I feel like there are a lot of people around me who have asked me, why risk yourself now? Because before we didn't, but now we have the National Security Law. Now we have Article 23, and all of these laws that are intended to push against this sort of activism.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I'd say it's not because of whatever benefit that might come down the line [that I do this]. It's to tell myself that when I saw tyranny in front of me, I did not back down. When I saw my friends and my family, my friends and a lot of them in the street, when I saw that injustice, when I saw them getting beat up by police officers, when I saw the newsreels about the sexual assaults, the violence, and when I saw the videos of the violence, I think‚Ä¶I don't want to be a coward. And not just that, I think it is my duty as someone‚Ä¶ this is my hope, alright? It is my duty to fight for my home, no matter how small, right? But I'll put [in] as much effort as I can.</p>
        
        <p class="response">But also, I think there [are] really a lot of perspectives on this around, even within my family. My mother and father [have] asked me the same question in different tones before, right? So, if this is only specific to me, I'll say that.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Post-2019 Legal Framework</h4>
            <p><strong>National Security Law (NSL):</strong> Imposed by Beijing in June 2020, criminalizing secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Penalties include life imprisonment.</p>
            <p><strong>Article 23:</strong> Additional security legislation passed in March 2024, further expanding definitions of national security crimes including treason, sedition, and theft of state secrets.</p>
            <p>These laws have resulted in mass arrests of activists, journalists, and opposition politicians, and created a climate where even attending memorials or expressing political views carries significant legal risk.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="response">And in terms of what the Hong Kong youth thinks about the current issue‚Ä¶because I talk to a lot of people about the pro-democracy movement, I think I try to keep a voice about it, I try to keep people aware of it. And I think there are a lot of people‚Äîit's an overwhelming majority that are against the Chinese government, but in a much more passive way, in a sort of soft resistance. I think it's more about preserving Hong Kong culture [that] is more important to them than the actual fight for democracy. It's because we're so young. I think they care less about the ideals, it's just more about now, oh, now there are more Mainland people in here. Now there are more Chinese-speaking people here, and that problem has sprung upon us. I have a few friends who are really vocally pro-democracy, and those people, I think, are the people who have actually read up, who are more educated on the political issues, and I think overall‚Ä¶ okay, I might be a bit skewed because I go to an international school. I think it's much more pro-democracy than your average Hong Kong school. But I have also been to DSE schools before, and I still think the majority opinion is‚Ä¶more an ambivalence. Hong Kong has changed a lot within recent years. But the people who are pro-democracy still exist. The people who are pro-China, I think, are shockingly little. At least they're quiet about it.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Hong Kong School Systems</h4>
            <p><strong>International Schools:</strong> Follow curricula like IB, British A-Levels, or American systems. Generally more expensive, diverse student bodies, instruction in English.</p>
            <p><strong>DSE Schools:</strong> Follow the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education curriculum, the local system. Instruction typically in Cantonese or Mandarin, more representative of general Hong Kong population.</p>
            <p>The participant's experience in both systems gives them perspective on political attitudes across different socioeconomic and educational backgrounds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">This is interesting, because, from the people that I've talked to at HKU, these people are‚Ä¶like, at least they don't feel like it's their civic duty [to protest]. They feel the other way around. They feel like‚Ä¶their obligation is to follow the law. So I don't know‚Ä¶you're still seeing a lot of people that still feel a certain way, but are not expressing them, maybe?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Um, okay‚Ä¶Before we talk about that, I think we really need to talk about the follow-the-law thing. Because it might be a really offhand comment, but it is really emblematic of what's happening in Hong Kong right now. There are a lot of people within society, who, even though they feel pro-Hong Kong [and] support democracy, just want to follow the law. That is a huge group. I think a lot of the people that I just now said are ambivalent‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Yes.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">They want to follow the law. There is a lot of trouble that could go ahead if you fight against the government in any way. You could be sent to jail nearly arbitrarily now for political issues.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I think the thing is, to a lot of people, it seems like [the law] is this list of things that can never change, and [that] you must follow. But, like, the law changed. The law is fluid, and there‚Ä¶ within the current‚Ä¶ I don't know if you've read the text of the current‚Ä¶ Wait, can you read Chinese? Can you speak Chinese? Per chance?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I can, yes.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Oh, okay, great. Just as context for later, within the current text of the National Security Law and the Basic Law, there is a lot of broad text, like, uh, È°õË¶Ü [xiandong], which means subversion, or‚Ä¶ and then there is ÂúãÂÆ∂ÂàÜË£Ç [guo jia fenlie], which is secession from China, and there are a lot of these big words that are put in the law. And they are not defined. So, anything can be secession, anything can be sedition. Anything can be against national security law. And so, I think, regarding following the law, in my own belief, I think it's ridiculous. The current law is untenable. The current law is basically there to stop anyone from trying to do anything pro-democracy.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Wait, can you repeat your second question again? I didn't catch.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">No, sorry, it wasn't a question, it was just my observation that‚Ä¶I mean, obviously, I don't have context pre-'19 or pre-'14, but it seems like a lot of people just don't‚Ä¶or at least from what they're saying, they don't necessarily care about the issue nearly as much anymore.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah, that's true. In 2019, it's probably the peak. After passing a national security law, after the passing of Article 23, a lot of those people just want to live a normal life now. I think there‚Ä¶ a lot of them are feeling a sort of pessimism towards Hong Kong democracy. It's like, there's nothing we can do anymore, and why don't we just live our lives as best as we can within the current system? That exists for a lot of people, and those‚Ä¶ The people who are really strongly against this sort of pessimism are probably not in Hong Kong anymore. And, yeah, so overall, your observation is really correct. Within Hong Kong society, there is ambivalence. [There's the feeling of,] I don't care anymore.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">It's been 6 years since the event. How [has] your view of Hong Kong as a whole changed?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">I feel like Hong Kong‚Ä¶is not the Hong Kong we knew 6 years ago. I think that's the first statement I'll make. And the second thing I'll say is, whatever is there now, it is not impossible to salvage. I feel like there's still [a] very distinct Hong Kong identity within the region, but I also feel like a lot of the institutions given to us by the UK have been slowly eroded. And I genuinely don't know what the future holds for Hong Kong. I don't see a path in which‚Ä¶under the current system, any sort of pro-democratic movement arises. Also, honestly, I don't see a path for China within the next, what, 20 years? Their current economic and demographic numbers are abysmal. They're stoking the fires for a war in Taiwan. I genuinely don't know how that will go. So, regarding Hong Kong as a whole, I think a lot of Hong Kongers still‚Ä¶ I don't know, okay, for me, I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I try to hold my head up. I try to not think about the fact that we're in a horrible society that probably never will have democracy for the foreseeable future. Currently I'm burdened by studies, but I am looking towards immigration as a solution for myself.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah. Let's go back to that Hong Kong identity, you said there's still a distinct Hong Kong identity, which is‚Ä¶from all the people that I've talked to, I think this is a‚Ä¶rarely definitive statement. My question is where you see the identity, I guess.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">So‚Ä¶Hong Kong is a very special place. It is molded with British colonialism, and with Chinese ethnic immigration, with the arrival of the Cantonese, and the distinct identity that brings, and also with our culture. We have a lot of culture, we have Ëå∂È§êÂª≥ [cha chaan teng], which are a symbol of the mixed culture between East and West, I think is a really good way to put it. But also, I think, especially during 2019, there's this identity of Hong Kong as sort of like Taiwan's nation building. There is a distinct Taiwanese identity, in my opinion, and I think there is a sort of that‚Ä¶coalescing together‚Ä¶within Hong Kong. To more precisely define this, I think there is this view within Hong Kong that Mainlanders are now the other. As like, they are‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Hmm.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">We are not the same. While we are both Han, ethnically Han and ethnically Chinese, there is also a distinct identity where‚Ä¶I think there was polling for this pre-2019‚Ä¶ pre-National Security Law on the identity of Hong Kongers‚Ä¶a lot of people started calling themselves Hongkongers a lot more. A lot of people started to refer to themselves as Hong Kong-Chinese.</p>
        
        <p class="response">The weird thing about Hong Kong is there is a shocking amount of ethno-nationalism. Maybe it's just because of my parents. My parents have a very weird ethno-nationalistic view of Hong Kong, as in we are Han Chinese, so we must not betray the Chinese people up north. Something along the lines of that.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Hong Kong Identity Surveys</h4>
            <p>Public opinion research by the University of Hong Kong tracked identity changes over time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-1997: Most identified as "Hong Konger" or "Hong Kong Chinese"</li>
                <li>Early 2000s: Brief increase in "Chinese" identity</li>
                <li>2010s onward: Sharp rise in exclusive "Hong Konger" identity, especially among youth</li>
                <li>2019 peak: Record numbers identifying as "Hong Konger" rather than "Chinese"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This shift paralleled growing tensions with Beijing and was particularly pronounced among younger generations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Interesting. I've never heard of that.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">And‚Ä¶ okay. Because‚Ä¶you have talked to other Hong Kong people, so‚Ä¶ I don't know how much you've heard about this, but there is a lot of racism within Hong Kong against Mainlanders, at least within the group I'm in, within my people, my friends. A lot of them really hate Chinese people.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I've alluded to the issue in interviews, and [most interviewees] give me the official answer, right? They say it's the tourists that are behaving in impolite ways [that are hated], but if you want to integrate in the community, it's very welcoming and all that stuff. But there's always a sense that [the hatred] might be real. Can you speak a little bit more on that?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">It's not welcoming, to be honest. At least within my friend groups. If you speak Mandarin, I think you get looks. I feel like there are a lot of times where my interactions with other people are, like, really racist, as in, I hold really negative views on Mainland people.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Hmm.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">When I hear someone speak Mainland Chinese next to me, my opinion of them decreases a lot, and that goes for a lot of my friends. I've heard my friends do really offhand comments when we're in the street, and‚Ä¶ and then they would just be like, oh, there's so many Mainland people here, and it's like, it's‚Ä¶ it's almost a slur. People give you the generic answer of, oh, it's welcoming if you want to integrate here. I don't believe that's true. At least not for the younger generations. Maybe it's still true for the older generations who believe in the one Han Chinese thing, but I think within recent years, there's a lot more nationalism and‚Ä¶ like, Hong Kong nationalism. I don't know [what] to call this, because‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p class="response">Oh, by the way, I just need to give you my stance on this. I don't support Hong Kong independence. I think we need to somehow work a framework where Hong Kong is. In my opinion, Hong Kong independence is unsustainable, at least for now. I don't think Hong Kong independence is a bad thing. I think it's just that we have [to do] a lot of work to get there, and it's much more tenable to go for a solution like semi-autonomy, or‚Ä¶what we saw in the SAR, at the start of the SAR, so‚Ä¶I just want to give you my views on that first, because I need a clear day on that.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Researcher Note:</strong> This section contains frank acknowledgment of anti-Mainland prejudice. The participant's candor about racist attitudes contrasts with the "polite" responses given by other interviewees. This reveals tensions between:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Political opposition to the Chinese government vs. prejudice toward Mainland people</li>
                <li>Public discourse emphasizing civic identity vs. private expressions of ethnic nationalism</li>
                <li>Stated principles of democracy and inclusion vs. actual discriminatory behavior</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The participant's self-awareness about these contradictions is notable, as is their discomfort with the implications.</p>

        <p class="response">Mhm.</p>

        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">So, uh, okay, back to the nationalism and the ethnic identity thing. I don't just see this against Mainlanders, I see a lot of people being racist against Indians and Black people. It's really offhand comments, but I have a lot of friends who would just say, oh, I hate Indians, I hate Indian accents, they stink, or, like, it's‚Ä¶It's weird. It's weird for a city. We are a so-called international city. We live in the precipice of East and West, but I still think there's this weird sense of ethnic nationalism. But, like, less ethnic, actually, linguisto-ethnic nationalism, because Cantonese is really important here. Cantonese and English, I'll say. If you're white, you don't get the bad looks. If you're brown or speak Mandarin‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">There are people who will look at you in a different way.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Why do you think that is? Maybe a better question is, where does the division between the Mandarin-speaking and the Canto-speaking originate?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">So, if you ask me why I think that is, I genuinely think [it's] because Mandarin people just have this‚Ä¶okay, mainland Chinese people, because I don't think it exists as much as Taiwanese people. I think we have [a] really positive opinion of Taiwanese people. But for mainland Chinese people, they do a lot of ridiculous stuff that genuinely doesn't function well in this society.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Have you been to Hong Kong?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Yes, I'm a Hong Kong citizen.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Oh! Oh! Okay. Within Hong Kong, I think there is this sort of‚Ä¶there's this sort of vibe. There's this, uh, like, our streets aren't the cleanest, but at least we don't have a lot of garbage on the floor. But with the mainlanders, maybe it's the culture thing. Um, I've seen a lot more people spitting on the floor, which is‚Ä¶And I've seen a lot more rubbish on the floor, personally. I've also seen a lot of videos of Mainlanders acting really out of place in society. I don't know, have you seen the videos of, like, within Japan, there are, like, foreign tourists who act crazy?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right, of course.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">It's the same way in Hong Kong, except‚Ä¶for us, we noticed a trend that a lot of those people are Mainlanders, and that, I think, has negatively shaped their views alongside the political tensions. I think [political tensions] also have shaped a lot of the views, but less so than the cultural aspect, I think.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">One thing I want to get to, and maybe this relates to‚Ä¶ back to where you draw the line of [political movements], but what is justice to you? What is a just society?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">What is justice? Wow, that's‚Ä¶ that's such a profound question. This is a really good question. Fairness, equity, I think that is all very important in justice. I think. The people having a voice, that's important to justice, I think. Actually, what do you mean by, what is justice? Is it, like, in terms of criminal justice? What do you mean?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I think justice‚Ä¶It's‚Ä¶ it's a philosophy, right? But it's also a sort of, I think, intuition that people develop about what is right, what is wrong, and what the consequences should be. Criminal justice is a big part of that, but also how we implement policies, how we shape policies, how people get to participate, what the roles of people are‚Ä¶so it's a very big question, but from the largest sort of standpoint, what do you see justice as? Let me give you an example, maybe, to contextualize.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah, I got the question. So, I think justice is about being just, right? It seems redundant, but it's about being fair. So, in terms of, like, I think Hong Kong still has a pretty good criminal justice system, right? If you don't touch national security law. I think it's because justice needs to be impartial. Because justice, at least within a criminal justice sense, is the remediation of conflict.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Okay.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Wait, I feel like you're more asking about what I view in terms of, like, the moral way?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Well, criminal justice is a big part of it, but I guess when we're thinking about, more so, the social contract, right, between the governing and the governed, what is justice there?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Okay, oh, okay, okay, okay. The social contract between the governing and the governed, I think‚Ä¶it's pretty cliche, but that Thomas Jefferson quote about how the government should be scared of the people, not the other way around. I think that is [a] pretty concise way to summarize my views there. I think it should be the people's power to decide their governments. It should be the people's power to determine that social contract for themselves. Like, uh, for example, let's use the example of self-determination. Like, why does a certain [person] have to have the right of self-determination? I think that should be up to their own people. People in Chicago don't want to have independence, because there's no need. So, they don't have that self-determination. But people of Japan might have a‚Ä¶they want to determine their own future, and I think‚Ä¶it's about people being able to determine that.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Philosophical Reference: Thomas Jefferson</h4>
            <p>The participant references Thomas Jefferson's philosophy on government, often paraphrased as "when the people fear the government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty." This reflects a belief in popular sovereignty and the right of citizens to challenge governmental authority.</p>

        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I'll end the interview here. Well, thank you, obviously, so much for talking to me, and this is very late, but‚Ä¶when you look at what's happening in countries like the U.S., do you lose faith in democracy?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yes. It's hard not to. With the US, I genuinely do not know if you guys will have a fair midterm. I do not know if democracy will be preserved [by] 2028. I'm really interested in American politics, and from what I've seen, I'm really not‚Ä¶confident in democracy, in the Constitution, and in‚Ä¶ look, like, I think you should know this. Trump has been arbitrarily breaking constitutional law practically since the first day of their term, too.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right, sure. And pre-Trump, too. Andrew Jackson, they've done it before, right?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah, and there's nothing that can be remediated. There's no course of remediation, because I've been thinking a lot about this question of, how do you balance the powers? In the US, you guys have the idea of the separation of powers, and the balance of that, right? But how do you maintain that balance?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Sure.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Right? Like, how does the judicial branch have oversight on the executive when the executive are the ones with the guns, are the ones with the practical political power? I think, to me, the answer to that is about reframing how we think about the government. Because‚Ä¶ but, okay, I'll talk less about that, let me talk more about America for now. It's also really hard to see the images coming out of CECOT, coming out of LA, coming out of the cities in the United States, and how the National Guard has been deployed in multiple cities, and in obvious violation of‚Ä¶I can't remember, the quartering of troops, I think, is it? [It is] an obvious violation of large parts of the law, and I think it's concerning.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I do see hope. I see a lot of people still wanting to fight for democracy, but I don't know if that can work. It's really hard to see a potential future for America. And if America does not maintain their democracy, who will fill their void? What will be the consequences of that, in terms of Taiwan, in terms of the many nations that border the United States, in terms of the United States' force projection capabilities. There [are] a lot of really big questions that will be answered soon, but I don't really want the answer to them.</p>

            <strong>Researcher Notes:</strong> This interview reveals a younger perspective shaped by direct participation in the 2019 protests as a minor. The participant's views on violence are more accepting than many other interviewees, seeing it as a justified last resort when peaceful means fail. Notable is the candid discussion of ethnic and racial tensions within Hong Kong society, including acknowledgment of racism against South Asian and Black residents alongside anti-Mainland sentiment. The participant's concerns about democratic erosion extend beyond Hong Kong to include anxieties about the United States' political trajectory.
