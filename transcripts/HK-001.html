            <strong>Participant Background:</strong> Hong Kong native who participated directly in the 2019 protests, influenced significantly by their older brother. First attended protests as a minor during the June 2019 demonstrations. The interview includes discussion of protest tactics, violence, ethnic tensions in Hong Kong, and views on democracy and justice.

        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Can you briefly introduce yourself? For example, where do you come from and what is a symbol or idea that represents Hong Kong for you?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Okay, so I'm a Hongkonger. I was born in Hong Kong and have lived there my whole life. I'm someone who cares deeply for Hong Kong. [In terms of a] symbol or idea that represents Hong Kong‚Ä¶I'd say it's the first frontier of the free world against China. [I don't really know] about symbols? I don't have any in my mind right now.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Got it. How do you view the relationship between the "free world" and China? Where do you define as the "free-world"?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">[The] free world is to me obviously Europe and Canada now; I would've said the U.S. a while ago but that's getting tenuous. Alongside these, I'd say Australia, ASEAN, Japan, Korea, India, [and] basically the democracies of the world.</p>
        
        <p class="response">The relationship between China and the free world is an interesting question. I'd say China is an active adversary trying to dismantle the rules-based international order, alongside other powers like Russia. But they do it in a much more covert way, and only to the benefit of themselves.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Understood. How would you say you first learned/got involved in the movements for Hong Kong? You mentioned that your brother was a big influence. Was the rest of your family in agreement in terms of these issues?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">[The] first time I learned about [the movements] was during dinner between me and my family. We had the TV on like normal. Then, the newsreels of [the event] popped up.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Getting involved was mostly with my brother going out and bringing me along to the protests. The rest of my family['s attitude ranges from] ambivalent to hostile to the protestors.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">How did you grow to believe that something was wrong? What prompted you to get on the streets, even though there might be clear dangers?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">I think, as a child, I was always very pro-freedom and interested in politics (I would spend my free time on [Wikipedia] just reading current affairs and history). If you ask me how and why I [got involved] back then, I don't really know. Now I viscerally remember seeing one of my brother['s] friends getting shot by a rubber bullet and getting beat up by police.</p>
        
        <p class="response">[There were] many many other horror stories, from people getting pulled behind pillars to get beat up to female protesters being harassed by [the] police. It's [an] injustice. It's tyranny, and I will carry on the mantle and fight against that no matter the cost.</p>
        
        <p class="response">In terms of what prompted me, I would say my brother obviously was the person who led me to the streets. I honestly never really felt the danger. Maybe I just don't remember it now [though]. It's all a bit fuzzy now.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Let's go back to your first protest...what did you see or feel at the time? Were you scared?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">It was June 16th during the "2 million+1" protest. I saw tons and tons of people holding signs, and I remembered the MTR being flooded with people in the morning when we were getting to Central. [I was] not really scared [since] we left before any major confrontations. It was just a march really.</p>
        
        <p class="response">It was sensory overload, too; I remember that a lot. So many things happening all at once. It took me a while to adjust to that.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Historical Context: June 16, 2019 Protest</h4>
            <p>The June 16, 2019 protest was one of the largest demonstrations in Hong Kong's history, with organizers claiming nearly 2 million participants (hence the reference to "2 million+1"). This followed the June 9 protest and came after the government's announcement to suspend (but not withdraw) the extradition bill. The demonstration was largely peaceful, with participants marching from Victoria Park to the Legislative Council complex.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I remember being in Mainland reading the HK news in 2019, and most of what I was reading about was the violence that was occurring - like this elderly person getting burned on a bridge or something like that. Were events like that frequent, from your experience? If they were truly somewhat violent, did your opinion of the movement shift?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Was there violence in the movement? Yes.</p>
        
        <p class="response">There were extreme sectors who fought the police's fire with fire. However, we mostly just escalated because [of] the police and government.</p>
        
        <p class="response">1. [They] did not listen to us when we were making our demands through peaceful means (we have been fighting for democracy[,] freedom and all that since 1997).</p>
        
        <p class="response">2. [We then] escalated [to] violence, [first on] 7/21 when they ignored protestors getting beat up by gangs (affiliated with the government), [next on] 8/31 when police beat people up in the subways, and 10/1 when they shot a protester.</p>
        
        <p class="response">They definitely got more frequent as the movement went on, as the peaceful sectors started to die down and get replaced by who we call "the brave ones" as we could see in the [PolyU] siege and events near the tail end of the movement. My opinion now is firmly that violence is a necessary means to political solution when all else fails, and I will not condemn violence solely for condemning violence. However, senseless violence should be condemned. Some people who got hurt by us definitely shouldn't have. Like, if I remember correctly, [the] elderly worker who got hit by a brick.</p>
        
        <div class="context-box">
            <h4>Historical Context: Key Escalation Events</h4>
            <p><strong>July 21 (7/21):</strong> The Yuen Long attack, where masked men in white shirts attacked protesters and civilians at the Yuen Long MTR station. Police response was widely criticized as inadequate.</p>
            <p><strong>August 31 (8/31):</strong> Prince Edward station incident, where police entered the MTR station and used force against passengers, leading to widespread allegations of brutality.</p>
            <p><strong>October 1 (10/1):</strong> A protester was shot in the chest with live ammunition by police during National Day protests.</p>
            <p><strong>PolyU Siege:</strong> The November 2019 siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where protesters and police clashed for nearly two weeks, resulting in numerous arrests.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I was just going to ask that question, actually. What do you think "civic duty" entails? (As in, many I have talked to believe that their job is just to make money and abide by the law, while I assume you believe otherwise). Secondly, where do you draw the line between "acceptable" versus "unacceptable" means of voicing disagreements?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">In my opinion, civic duty is the responsibility of every citizen to defend their rights, their freedoms, their democracy, [and] their friends. If people don't have that sense of civic duty, democracy is fraught, even if that is not "legal."</p>
        
        <p class="response">Now, in terms of what is acceptable/unacceptable, I don't think there's a clean answer to this. To me, it really depends on context. If you could give me some case studies, I could discuss what I think about them specifically [in order that you] understand my viewpoint about that.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Well, I guess the role of violence would be a good place to start. To what degree do you think force should be avoided or used when defending a perceived right?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Again, it really depends on context. Violence in politics is a really bad word; no one likes it [and] no one condones it. But the practical reality is that violence cannot be avoided.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Format Note:</strong> At this point in the interview, the conversation switched from text to audio call. The following represents the audio portion of the interview.
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">No, because the thing is, let me start off with prefacing: the word violence within politics is kind of a‚Ä¶It's a banned term. I think no one would want to condone violence. At least no sane person would, like, in public, right?</p>
        
        <p class="response">And I feel like‚Ä¶ yes, in an ideal world, we shouldn't stoop down to violence. But again, we live in a world where it's not ideal. There are times where I have to resort to violence to achieve political goals.</p>
        
        <p class="response">And so, if you ask me what I draw the line‚Ä¶ what's the line I draw for violence is‚Ä¶I think‚Ä¶ mmm‚Ä¶I would say‚Ä¶I support violence only as the final fight. The final‚Ä¶Hmm. What's the right word here? As‚Ä¶ it's the‚Ä¶It's the end. It's the end means, I think.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Because it's‚Ä¶ if you have tried‚Ä¶ if you have tried every single other way to achieve your goal within the system, outside of the system, peacefully. And if your goal has failed, say, I don't think violence is necessarily bad, but you have to have tried everything. And obviously, it's kind of, like, selfish or weird to say this. I'll obviously only believe [that violence is justified] in the fight for my ideals. I don't think violence should be used in hate. I think that is horrible. I think violence should only be used in the preservation of democracy, in the preservation of civic identity, in the preservation of a country.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I don't want my words to be warped into saying, I support violence. There's a line. I think it's about using violence to just defend a civic institution to defend democracy. I'd say that that will be like the broad way to say it, but, yeah, along the lines of that.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Mhm.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Topic Transition:</strong> The conversation shifts to discussing ethnic and linguistic tensions in Hong Kong.
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">So, uh, okay, back to the nationalism and the ethnic identity thing. I don't just see this against Mainlanders, I see a lot of people being racist against Indians and Black people. It's really offhand comments, but I have a lot of friends who would just say, oh, I hate Indians, I hate Indian accents, they stink, or, like, it's‚Ä¶It's weird. It's weird for a city. We are a so-called international city. We live in the precipice of East and West, but I still think there's this weird sense of ethnic nationalism. But, like, less ethnic, actually, linguisto-ethnic nationalism, because Cantonese is really important here. Cantonese and English, I'll say. If you're white, you don't get the bad looks. If you're brown or speak Mandarin‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">There are people who will look at you in a different way.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Why do you think that is? Maybe a better question is, where does the division between the Mandarin-speaking and the Canto-speaking originate?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">So, if you ask me why I think that is, I genuinely think [it's] because Mandarin people just have this‚Ä¶okay, mainland Chinese people, because I don't think it exists as much as Taiwanese people. I think we have [a] really positive opinion of Taiwanese people. But for mainland Chinese people, they do a lot of ridiculous stuff that genuinely doesn't function well in this society.</p>
        
        <p class="response">Have you been to Hong Kong?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Yes, I'm a Hong Kong citizen.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Oh! Oh! Okay. Within Hong Kong, I think there is this sort of‚Ä¶there's this sort of vibe. There's this, uh, like, our streets aren't the cleanest, but at least we don't have a lot of garbage on the floor. But with the mainlanders, maybe it's the culture thing. Um, I've seen a lot more people spitting on the floor, which is‚Ä¶And I've seen a lot more rubbish on the floor, personally. I've also seen a lot of videos of Mainlanders acting really out of place in society. I don't know, have you seen the videos of, like, within Japan, there are, like, foreign tourists who act crazy?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right, of course.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">It's the same way in Hong Kong, except‚Ä¶for us, we noticed a trend that a lot of those people are Mainlanders, and that, I think, has negatively shaped their views alongside the political tensions. I think [political tensions] also have shaped a lot of the views, but less so than the cultural aspect, I think.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">One thing I want to get to, and maybe this relates to‚Ä¶ back to where you draw the line of [political movements], but what is justice to you? What is a just society?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">What is justice? Wow, that's‚Ä¶ that's such a profound question. This is a really good question. Fairness, equity, I think that is all very important in justice. I think. The people having a voice, that's important to justice, I think. Actually, what do you mean by, what is justice? Is it, like, in terms of criminal justice? What do you mean?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I think justice‚Ä¶It's‚Ä¶ it's a philosophy, right? But it's also a sort of, I think, intuition that people develop about what is right, what is wrong, and what the consequences should be. Criminal justice is a big part of that, but also how we implement policies, how we shape policies, how people get to participate, what the roles of people are‚Ä¶so it's a very big question, but from the largest sort of standpoint, what do you see justice as? Let me give you an example, maybe, to contextualize.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah, I got the question. So, I think justice is about being just, right? It seems redundant, but it's about being fair. So, in terms of, like, I think Hong Kong still has a pretty good criminal justice system, right? If you don't touch national security law. I think it's because justice needs to be impartial. Because justice, at least within a criminal justice sense, is the remediation of conflict.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Okay.</p>

        <p class="response">Wait, I feel like you're more asking about what I view in terms of, like, the moral way?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Well, criminal justice is a big part of it, but I guess when we're thinking about, more so, the social contract, right, between the governing and the governed, what is justice there?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Okay, oh, okay, okay, okay. The social contract between the governing and the governed, I think‚Ä¶it's pretty cliche, but that Thomas Jefferson quote about how the government should be scared of the people, not the other way around. I think that is [a] pretty concise way to summarize my views there. I think it should be the people's power to decide their governments. It should be the people's power to determine that social contract for themselves. Like, uh, for example, let's use the example of self-determination. Like, why does a certain [person] have to have the right of self-determination? I think that should be up to their own people. People in Chicago don't want to have independence, because there's no need. So, they don't have that self-determination. But people of Japan might have a‚Ä¶they want to determine their own future, and I think‚Ä¶it's about people being able to determine that.</p>

            <h4>Philosophical Reference: Thomas Jefferson</h4>
            <p>The participant references Thomas Jefferson's philosophy on government, often paraphrased as "when the people fear the government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty." This reflects a belief in popular sovereignty and the right of citizens to challenge governmental authority.</p>

        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">I'll end the interview here. Well, thank you, obviously, so much for talking to me, and this is very late, but‚Ä¶when you look at what's happening in countries like the U.S., do you lose faith in democracy?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yes. It's hard not to. With the US, I genuinely do not know if you guys will have a fair midterm. I do not know if democracy will be preserved [by] 2028. I'm really interested in American politics, and from what I've seen, I'm really not‚Ä¶confident in democracy, in the Constitution, and in‚Ä¶ look, like, I think you should know this. Trump has been arbitrarily breaking constitutional law practically since the first day of their term, too.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Right, sure. And pre-Trump, too. Andrew Jackson, they've done it before, right?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Yeah, and there's nothing that can be remediated. There's no course of remediation, because I've been thinking a lot about this question of, how do you balance the powers? In the US, you guys have the idea of the separation of powers, and the balance of that, right? But how do you maintain that balance?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker interviewer">INTERVIEWER</p>
        <p class="response">Sure.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">ANON</p>
        <p class="response">Right? Like, how does the judicial branch have oversight on the executive when the executive are the ones with the guns, are the ones with the practical political power? I think, to me, the answer to that is about reframing how we think about the government. Because‚Ä¶ but, okay, I'll talk less about that, let me talk more about America for now. It's also really hard to see the images coming out of CECOT, coming out of LA, coming out of the cities in the United States, and how the National Guard has been deployed in multiple cities, and in obvious violation of‚Ä¶I can't remember, the quartering of troops, I think, is it? [It is] an obvious violation of large parts of the law, and I think it's concerning.</p>
        
        <p class="response">I do see hope. I see a lot of people still wanting to fight for democracy, but I don't know if that can work. It's really hard to see a potential future for America. And if America does not maintain their democracy, who will fill their void? What will be the consequences of that, in terms of Taiwan, in terms of the many nations that border the United States, in terms of the United States' force projection capabilities. There [are] a lot of really big questions that will be answered soon, but I don't really want the answer to them.</p>

            <strong>Researcher Notes:</strong> This interview reveals a younger perspective shaped by direct participation in the 2019 protests as a minor. The participant's views on violence are more accepting than many other interviewees, seeing it as a justified last resort when peaceful means fail. Notable is the candid discussion of ethnic and racial tensions within Hong Kong society, including acknowledgment of racism against South Asian and Black residents alongside anti-Mainland sentiment. The participant's concerns about democratic erosion extend beyond Hong Kong to include anxieties about the United States' political trajectory.
